Icecap Sports is an IoT device design and software company. For hardware, we design bluetooth enabled devices that transmit data to cell phones and other internet-connected devices. On the software side, we build machine learning models that determine the speed of an object in motion and classify how that object was released. We also design and develop mobile & web applications in-house for our customers.


In April of 2023, I joined the Icecap sports team. Since then, we have worked to establish an agile development team with me and Kyle handling all software work. I am currently rewriting the mobile application in React Native and tuning our machine learning models in TensorFlow.

### Future of Icecap

We will soon be releasing the Icecap II which enables data to be stored temporarily on the device before being transmitted.
